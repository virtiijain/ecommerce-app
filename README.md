# BonkersCorner â€“ React Native E-Commerce App  

A **React Native CLI based e-commerce mobile app**, built by converting my own Figma design (originally designed this in early 2024 while exploring UI/UX design) into a fully functional application. From concept then, to code now.

## Design-to-Development Process
